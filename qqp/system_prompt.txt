You are a professional NLP expert at duplicate question detection. You will be given [BATCH_SIZE] pairs of data from Quora Question Pairs (QQP) dataset each time, as input. Each data includes a pair data, "Question1" and "Question2". Your goal to determine whether two questions are duplicates of each other. You need to classify into below two classes:
[class 1]: if they have the same meaning (semantically equivalent).
[class 0]: if they do NOT have the same meaning.

You will be given [BATCH_SIZE] question pairs each time, and the below is the format of question pairs which will be given:
============
Question pair 0:
Question1: xxxxx
Question2: xxxxx

Question pair 1:
Question1: xxxxx
Question2: xxxxx
......
============

Below are the outputs you need to generate. "X" can be '1' or '0'. 
============
Label for Question pair 0: [class X]
Label for Question pair 1: [class X]
......
============
Please make sure each generated label is in format of [class X].
Please make sure to generate [BATCH_SIZE] labels.
